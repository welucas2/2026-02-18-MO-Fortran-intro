## Array sections

A general subset of array elements, an *array section*,  may be constructed
from a triplet with a start and end subscript and a stride:

```
  [subscript] : [subscript] [: stride]
```

Given a rank 1 array `a(:)`, some valid array sub-objects are:

```
  a         ! the whole array
  a(:)      ! the whole array again
  a(1:4)    ! array section [ a(1), a(2), a(3), a(4) ]
  a(:4)     ! all elements up to and including a(4)
  a(2::2)   ! elements a(2), a(4), a(6), ...
```

If an array subscript is present, it must be valid; if the stride is present
it may not be zero.

## Array expressions and assignments

Intrinsic operations can be used to construct expressions which are
arrays. For example:

```
  integer, dimension(4, 8) :: a1, a2
  integer, dimension(4)    :: b1

  a1 = 0                      ! initialise all elements to zero
  a2 = a1 + 1                 ! all elements of a2(:,:)
  a1 = 2*a1                   ! multiplied element-wise

  b1 = a1(:, 1)               ! b1 set to first column of a1
```

Such expressions and assignments must take place between entities with
the same shape (they are said to *conform*). A scalar conforms
with an array of any shape.

Given the above declarations, the following would not make sense:

```
  b1 = a1
```

### Exercise (2 minutes)

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

## Array appearance

A caution. How should we interpret the following assignments?

```
  d = 1.0
  e(:) = 1.0
```

Compile the accompanying program
[example1.f90](exercises/06-array-expressions/example1.f90), check the
compilation errors and improve the program.

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

The first assignment given above is ambiguous. Is `d` a scalar variable, or
an entire array? The second assignment is clearly on every element of the
rank-1 array `e`.

The compiler errors you get when compiling
[example1.f90](exercises/06-array-expressions/example1.f90) may spell out
exactly what is going wrong. At line 13,

```source
b1 = a1
```

`b1` is a rank-1 array; the rank-2 array `a1` cannot be used to assign values to it. Change it to

```source
b1(:) = a1(:,1)
```

Then, the second issue is the assignment

```source
b1(1:4) = a2(1, 4:4)
```

as the section `a2(1, 4:4)` is an array of the incorrect size
(note that `a2(1, 4)` would work as it becomes a scalar, but wouldn't set
`b2` to the first half of the first row of `a2`). To correct the error, fix
the start index:

```source
b1(1:4) = a2(1, 1:4)
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  callout

## Array style

Following this exercise, you hopefullly agree it may be a good idea to prefer
use of `a(:)` over `a` when referencing the whole array. The former has the
appearance of an array, while the latter may incorrectly appear to be a scalar
to an unfamiliar reader of the code (or you yourself if it's been a while
since you last read it).


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Elemental intrinsic functions

Many intrinsic functions are *elemental*: that is, a call with a scalar
argument will return a scalar, while a call with an array argument will
return an array with the result of the function for each individual
element of the argument.
For example,

```
   real, dimension(4) :: a, b
   ...
   b(1:4) = cos(a(1:4))
```

will fill each element of `b` with the cosine of the corresponding element in
`a`.

## Reductions

Other intrinsic functions can be used to perform reduction operations
on arrays, and usually return a scalar. Common reductions are

```
   a = minval( [1.0, 2.0, 3.0] )  ! the minimum value from the array
   b = maxval( [1.0, 2.0, 3.0] )  ! the maximum value from the array
   c = sum(array(:))              ! the sum of all values in the array
```

## Logical expressions and masks

There is an array equivalent of the `if` construct called `where`, e.g.,:

```
  real, dimension(20) :: a
  ...
  where (a(:) >= 0.0)
    a(:) = sqrt(a(:))
  end where
```

which performs the appropriate operations element-wise. Formally,

```
  where (array-logical-expr)
    array-assignments
  end where
```

in which all the *array-logical-expr* and *array-assignments* must have the
same shape.

Logical functions `any()`, `all()`, and others may be used to reduce logical
arrays or array expressions. These return a `logical` value so can be used in an
`if` statement:

```
   if (any(a(:) < 0.0)) then
     ! do something if at least one element of a(:) is negative
   end if
   if (all(a(:) < 0.0)) then
     ! do something if every element of a(:) is negative
   end if
```

Some intrinsic functions have an optional mask argument which can be used to
restrict the operations to certain elements, e.g.,

```
  b = min(array(:), mask = (array(:) > 0.0))     ! minimum of positive value
  n = count(array(:), mask = (array(:) > 0.0))   ! count the number of positive values
```

These may be useful in certain situations.

### Another caution

There may be a temptation to start to construct array expressions of baroque
complexity, perhaps in the search for brevity. This temptation is probably
best avoided:

1. Such expressions can become very hard to read and interpret for correctness;
2. Performance: compilers may struggle to generate the best code if expressions are very complex. Array expressions and constructs may not work in parallel: explicit loops may provide better opportunities.

If array expressions are used, simple ones are best.

## Quadratic equation

The template [exercise1.f90](exercises/06-array-expressions/exercise1.f90)
re-visits the quadratic equation exercise. Check you can replace the scalars
where appropriate. See the template for further instructions.

## Sieve of Eratosthenes

Here's an additional exercise: write a program to implement the [Sieve of
Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes) algorithm
which performs a search for prime numbers. See
[exercise2.f90](exercises/06-array-expressions/exercise2.f90) for a template
with some further instructions. How much array syntax can you reasonably
introduce?

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

A sample solution is provided in [solution.f90](exercises/06-array-expressions/solutions/solution.f90).

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- Fortran allows flexible operations on arrays or subsets of array elements and provides numerous intrinsic functions for such operations.
- Some of these, such as `all()` and `any()` can be useful in directing the logical flow of a program.
